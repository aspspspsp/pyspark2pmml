PySpark2PMML
============

Python library for converting Apache Spark ML pipelines to PMML.

# Features #

This library is a thin wrapper around the [JPMML-SparkML](https://github.com/jpmml/jpmml-sparkml) library. For a list of supported Apache Spark ML Estimator and Transformer types, please refer to the documentation of the JPMML-SparkML project.

# Prerequisites #

* [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) 2.0.X, 2.1.X, 2.2.X or 2.3.X.
* Python 2.7, 3.4 or newer.

# Installation #

Install the latest version from GitHub:
```
pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/jpmml/pyspark2pmml.git
```

# Configuration #

PySpark2PMML must be paired with JPMML-SparkML based on the following compatibility matrix:

| Apache Spark version | JPMML-SparkML development branch | JPMML-SparkML version |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 2.0.X | `1.1.X` | 1.1.20 |
| 2.1.X | `1.2.X` | 1.2.12 |
| 2.2.X | `1.3.X` | 1.3.8 |
| 2.3.X | `master` | 1.4.5 |

### Apache Spark 2.3.X

Launch PySpark; use the `--packages` command-line option to specify the Maven Central repository coordinates of the JPMML-SparkML library:
```
pyspark --packages org.jpmml:jpmml-sparkml:${version}
```

### Apache Spark 2.0.X through 2.2.X

Apache Spark versions prior to 2.3.0 prepend a legacy version of the JPMML-Model library to application classpath, which brings about fatal class loading errors with all JPMML software, including the JPMML-SparkML library. This conflict is documented in [SPARK-15526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15526).

The workaround is to switch from the JPMML-SparkML library to the JPMML-SparkML uber-JAR file that bundles "shaded" classes. Pre-built JPMML-SparkML uber-JAR files can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/jpmml/jpmml-sparkml/releases). Alternatively, they can be built locally from source checkout using Apache Maven.

Launch PySpark; use the `--jars` command-line option to specify the location of the JPMML-SparkML uber-JAR file:
```
pyspark --jars /path/to/jpmml-sparkml-executable-${version}.jar
```

# Usage #

Fitting an example pipeline model:
```python
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.classification import DecisionTreeClassifier
from pyspark.ml.feature import RFormula

df = spark.read.csv("Iris.csv", header = True, inferSchema = True)

formula = RFormula(formula = "Species ~ .")
classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()
pipeline = Pipeline(stages = [formula, classifier])
pipelineModel = pipeline.fit(df)
```

Exporting the fitted example pipeline model to PMML byte array:
```python
from pyspark2pmml import PMMLBuilder

pmmlBuilder = PMMLBuilder(sc, df, pipelineModel) \
	.putOption(classifier, "compact", True)

pmmlBytes = pmmlBuilder.buildByteArray()
print(pmmlBytes.decode("UTF-8"))
```
